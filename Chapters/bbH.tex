\subsection{Summary of Theory Developments}

In this section, we present a summary of state-of-the-art predictions for \bbH{} production. Although its production rate at the LHC is comparable to that of $t\bar{t}H$, Higgs boson production in association with bottom quarks poses greater experimental challenges due to the lack of distinct electroweak signatures. The \bbH{} process receives contributions from both top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa interactions, including interference terms. The small but non-negligible value of the bottom-quark mass compared to LHC energies makes the modelling of this process particularly interesting.

In the zero-mass variable-flavour number scheme (ZM-VFNS), the bottom quark can be treated as a massless parton, allowing for the resummation of collinear logarithmic contributions into the parton distribution functions, while neglecting power-suppressed terms in the bottom-quark mass. This approach defines the five-flavour scheme (5FS), where the cross-section is currently known at \nnnlo{} QCD accuracy from~\citere{Duhr:2019kwi}. Additionally, the transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra have been described by resummed analytic predictions in~\citeres{Cal:2023mib,Das:2024pac}. The NNLO predictions~\cite{Harlander:2003ai} have been matched with parton shower at fully-exclusive level in~\citeres{Biello:2024vdh,Gavardi:2025zpf}. These predictions are proportional to the squared bottom-quark Yukawa coupling, and the interference with top-quark contributions vanishes due to the massless treatment of the bottom-quark.

Alternatively, \bbH{} production can be described within a four-flavour scheme (4FS), where bottom quarks are treated as massive and produced explicitly in the hard scattering together with the Higgs boson. This approach allows for a systematic inclusion of all the bottom-quark mass effects order by order in perturbative QCD and a complete knowledge of the bottom-quark kinematics, beyond the 5FS collinear approximation. Fixed-order predictions in the 4FS are currently known exactly at NLO accuracy, including the interference between top- and bottom-Yukawa induced contributions~\cite{Dittmaier:2003ej,Dawson:2003kb,Wiesemann:2014ioa}. The first determination of NNLO corrections in the bottom-quark Yukawa channel has been presented in~\citere{Biello:2024pgo} using the \minnlo{} method for a parton-shower matching. The calculation is exact except for the double virtual contribution, which is estimated in the small bottom-mass limit, making use of the analytic knowledge of the two-loop amplitude with massless bottom quarks~\cite{Badger:2021ega,Badger:2024mir}. Beyond the purely bottom-quark Yukawa contribution, the top-quark loop effects that enter for the first time at NLO are numerically important. Therefore, the NLO prediction for the $y_t^2$ component has been computed separately in the heavy top-quark effective field theory (HEFT) limit~\cite{Deutschmann:2018avk}, highlighting the relevance of this production mode in describing QCD backgrounds for di-Higgs searches~\cite{Manzoni:2023qaf}. In the complete-NLO calculation, additional contributions have been found to compete with the bottom-Yukawa–induced component~\cite{Pagani:2020rsg}.

The two flavour schemes capture different aspects of the heavy-quark mass effects, and a combination of the two approaches is needed for a faithful determination of the cross-section. Matched inclusive predictions have been first performed using a phenomenological combination known as Santander matching~\cite{Harlander:2011aa}. Two systematic approaches have been developed to combine the 4FS and 5FS cross sections while avoiding double-counting: the FONLL method~\cite{Forte:2015hba,Forte:2016sja} and the \nlonnllpart{} approach~\cite{Bonvini:2015pxa,Bonvini:2016fgf}. The FONLL-B variant matches NNLO predictions in the 5FS with NLO predictions in the 4FS and agrees well with the \nlonnllpart{} results across different values of the Higgs boson mass, as shown in YR4~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2016ypw}. Recently, the \nnnlo{} 5FS prediction has been matched with NLO 4FS cross-sections in~\citere{Duhr:2020kzd} using the FONLL method, reaching a novel level of accuracy in matched fully-inclusive results. Alternative general-mass variable-flavour number scheme (GM-VFNS) approaches, such as that in~\citere{Gauld:2021zmq}, can be employed to obtain matched predictions at both inclusive and fully-differential levels.

\paragraph{Recommendation}
The advantage of the \nlonnllpart{} method is the presence of an explicit dependence on a resummation scale $\mu_b$ that enables the incorporation of a resummation uncertainty estimation in the predictions. For this reason, the current recommendation of the LHCHWG is based on the \nlonnllpart{} method.

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:bbf_cite} displays the theoretical references on which the cross-section predictions presented here are based. The available samplings are obtained using the code developed in~\cite{Bonvini:2016fgf}, based on the \nlonnllpart{} method, which matches NNLO QCD 5FS predictions with NLO QCD 4FS results. The matching is performed à la resummation way for the $y_b^2$ component of the cross-section, schematically:
\begin{align}
	\sigma^{\text{\nlonnllpartnointf}}=\sigma^{\text{resum}}+\left( \sigma^{\text{FO}} - \left.\sigma^{\text{resum}}\right|_{\mu_b=\mu_F} \right)\,.	\label{eq:FSmatching}
\end{align}
Here, $\sigma^{\text{resum}}$ denotes the prediction in which collinear logarithms are resummed. It is based on the 5FS calculation and depends on the $b$-quark matching scale $\mu_b$, which is of the order of the bottom-quark mass $m_b$. The fixed-order counterpart, $\sigma^{\text{FO}}$, is obtained from the $y_b^2$ component of the 4FS computation. The overlapping logarithmic contributions are subtracted using the resummed result evaluated at the hard scale $\mu_b = \mu_F$, where effectively only the perturbative logarithms are present and no resummation is applied. The non-singular interference component proportional to $y_t y_b$, which is present in the 4FS computation, can be added without introducing any double-counting issues:
\begin{align}
	\sigma^{\text{\nlonnllpart}} = \sigma^{\text{\nlonnllpartnointf}} + \sigma^{y_b y_t}\,.
\end{align}
In Tables~\ref{tab:bbH7},~\ref{tab:bbH8},~\ref{tab:bbH13} and~\ref{tab:bbH14} we report the \nlonnllpart{} cross-sections at respectively 7, 8, 13, and 14 TeV. These numbers are obtained using the following central values for the renormalisation and factorisation scales:
\begin{align}
\mu_F=\frac{1}{4}(m_H+2m_b),\hspace{1cm}\mu_R=\frac{1}{2}m_H.
\end{align}
The standard choice for the resummation scale $\mu_b$ is the bottom-quark mass; however, in regions where $\mu_b/\mu_F > 0.3$, this scale is chosen according to a more general profile, as explained in~\citere{Bonvini:2016fgf}.

Theoretical uncertainties from renormalisation and factorisation scale variations are estimated using the envelope of the standard 7-point method and are denoted as $\delta(\mu_R,\mu_F)$.
In addition, we assess the uncertainty associated with the resummation scale $\mu_b$ by varying it up and down by a factor of two, and denote this contribution as $\delta(\mu_b)$.
The two sources of theoretical uncertainty are then combined in quadrature to obtain the total theoretical uncertainty, $\delta(\text{theory})$. In the tables, we also report the parametric uncertainties associated with the parton distribution functions, $\delta(\text{PDF})$, the strong coupling constant, $\delta(\alpha_s)$, and the bottom-quark mass, $\delta(m_b)$. The latter has been included due to its particular relevance for \bbH{} predictions, especially through its impact on the determination of the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling. These contributions are combined in quadrature to obtain the total parametric uncertainty, $\delta(\text{PDF}+\alpha_s+m_b)$.

The predictions at 13.6 TeV, summarised in~\tab{tab:bbH136}, are obtained through linear interpolation from cross-section grids at 13 and 14 TeV, using the relation
\begin{align}
	\sigma_{b\bar{b}H}(\sqrt{s}=13.6\,\text{TeV})=0.4\,\sigma_{b\bar{b}H}(\sqrt{s}=13.0\,\text{TeV})+0.6\,\sigma_{b\bar{b}H}(\sqrt{s}=14.0\,\text{TeV})\,.
\end{align}
Tests on the accuracy of the linear interpolation have been performed using existing cross-section predictions at 13.5 TeV in~\citere{10.21468/SciPostPhysCommRep.18}. Given the sizeable theoretical perturbative uncertainties in this process, and the goodness of the interpolation procedure, dedicated runs at 13.6 TeV are not required.
